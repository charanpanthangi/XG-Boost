# XGBoost Classification and Regression Model

This repository provides an implementation of XGBoost for both classification and regression tasks. The project demonstrates how to perform univariate and bivariate analysis, train and evaluate XGBoost models, and save/load models using `.pkl` files.

## Overview
This project demonstrates:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzing the distribution of each feature.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Visualizing relationships between features.
- **XGBoost Classification**: Training and evaluating an XGBoost classification model.
- **XGBoost Regression**: Training and evaluating an XGBoost regression model.
- **Model Saving**: Saving the trained models as `.pkl` files.
- **Model Loading**: Loading saved models and making predictions with new data.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `xgboost`
  - `seaborn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pickle`

Install the required packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xgboost-model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd xgboost-model
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
Replace `'your_data.csv'` in the code with the path to your dataset file.

### Example dataset structure:
- Features: `feature1`, `feature2`, `feature3`, etc.
- For classification: `class_target`
- For regression: `reg_target`

## Univariate & Bivariate Analysis
- **Univariate Analysis**: Histograms are plotted to understand the distribution of each feature.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Pair plots visualize the relationships between features.

## XGBoost Classification
- **Model Training**: An XGBoost classifier is trained and evaluated.
- **Saving Model**: The trained classifier is saved as `xgb_classifier.pkl`.

## XGBoost Regression
- **Model Training**: An XGBoost regressor is trained and evaluated.
- **Saving Model**: The trained regressor is saved as `xgb_regressor.pkl`.

## Model Saving & Loading
- **Saving Models**: Models are saved using `pickle` as `.pkl` files.
- **Loading Models**: Saved models are loaded to make predictions with new data.

## Usage
1. Replace `'your_data.csv'` with your dataset file path in the script.
2. Run the Python script to perform analysis, train the XGBoost models, and save them:
   ```bash
   python xgboost_model.py
   ```
3. To make predictions with new input data, use the provided code to load the model and pass new data.

## Results
- **Classification**: The classifier's accuracy is printed.
- **Regression**: The regressor's Mean Squared Error (MSE) is printed.
- **Predictions**: Predictions for new input data are shown.
